# Jack-Black

Creators: Mevan Solanga, Christopher Rene Koo Chin Fong, Karan Kapoor

Blackjack is a unique card game, where, instead of playing among each other, the players compete against a dealer.
This distinctiveness of Blackjack leads to a special problem - while playing with a group of friends, one of the friends needs to take up the role of the dealer, which could be quite boring, since the dealer needs to follow basic rules and distribute cards.
In the project, this problem is solved by creating a robot which can take up the role of the dealer in blackjack, and a decision was made to name to name our robot - "Jack Black".
